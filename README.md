# Welcome to Tejashree Kulkarni’s Digital Playground 👩‍💻

## About Me 🎓
Hello there! I’m Tejashree Kulkarni, a Computer Engineer, verification wizard, and all-around hardware design enthusiast. With a master’s degree from NC State and a mind geared for tech mysteries, I’ve made it my mission to solve every bug, optimize every cycle, and push every transistor to its absolute limit. My portfolio is a deep dive into the projects, skills, and adventures I’ve had in the world of computer engineering – and you’re invited to explore!

## Portfolio Highlights 🚀
Head over to [my GitHub Pages site](https://tejk28.github.io) to dive into:
- **Project Case Studies**: From wrangling I2C bus controllers to designing 3nm SRAM circuits that could probably fit on a pinhead, I love pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in hardware and verification.
- **Skills that Pay the Bills**: Verilog, SystemVerilog, UVM, and an ever-expanding collection of industry-standard EDA tools.
- **Quirky Commentary**: I don’t just tell you *what* I’ve done – I add a splash of fun and perspective on *how* I’ve done it (and why).

## Why This Portfolio? 🤔
If you’re curious about design verification, physical design, or computer architecture, you’ll find some relatable insights here. Think of it as a digital sandbox where serious engineering meets a hint of whimsy.
